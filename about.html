    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Founded by Juan Josue Orozco, a U.S. military veteran with a background in data analytics and real estate strategy, OrozcoRealty LLC was built to serve the needs of underserved communities and fellow veterans. Located in El Cenizo, Texas, the company focuses on transforming neglected and foreclosed properties into safe, affordable homes.</p>

    <h2>Veteran-Led Purpose</h2>
    <p>As a 100% veteran-owned business, OrozcoRealty leverages veteran benefits and programs to minimize startup costs and maximize community impact. Our work provides housing solutions for active duty personnel stationed at Lackland AFB, low-income families, and first-time buyers.</p>

    <h2>Vision & Values</h2>
    <p>We believe in dignity through housing. Our projects are driven by the values of service, responsibility, and family. Whether it’s a rent-to-own home or a Section 8-certified unit, every property we touch is meant to create a future of ownership, stability, and pride.</p>

    <h2>Leadership</h2>
    <p>Juan's father, a retired construction foreman with decades of experience, leads renovation projects on-site. Together, this family-run business combines technical skill and operational insight with a mission-focused, data-driven approach.</p>
